Hello everyone! I just came back from an exhausting and at the same time really amazing weekend. I took part in Trivagos  (yes, the hotel search engine) annual Hackathon. This year was my second participation so I had a rough idea about what to expect and how everything is going to work. And indeed, the team over at Trivago didn't change a whole lot.

Great food and drinks, an amazing office space and a lot of talented and friendly coders. Oh, and there was free pizza at midnight as well! What else do you need to have a great weekend?

## The concept

For everyone who is not familiar with the concept, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) does a good job at explaining it: "A hackathon is an event in which computer programmers and others involved in software development, including interface designers and project managers, collaborate intensively on software projects". And that's exactly what we did the last couple days, 28 hours in total.

This years theme was all about the Trivago API. We had the chance and were encouraged to use the offical Trivago Affiliate API to built something great around it.

The almost 50 participants formed groups and got pretty much straight into coding. I was there as an interface designer and frontend developer, but ended up working a lot on our logo, the product design and the final presentation.

## Trivago HotelFeed – what we came up with

Our group "undefined" had the idea to the improve the normal Trivago homepage and enhance the hotel information it provides with more and bigger pictures, local points of interest, nearby PokéStops and other useful information like weather for example.

To make use of the API, we fetched data from it and combined it with other APIs from different services. In the end we were able to get information from sites like Flickr, Open Weather Map, Yelp, Foursquare and of course – Trivago.

To make it easy for everyone to use, we put everyhing into a google extention. With one simple click, users are able to see a lot more information about potential hotels – without the need to leave the Trivago homepage. In the end I would say we built a good looking and all around solid plugin. For everyone interested, you can check out our [API on github](https://github.com/Sommerfeld/trivago_api_2.0), we did not release the plugin, yet.

## Conclusion

To sum it up I would say this years hackathon was again a really great experience and I met a lot of interesting people. I hope I get the chance to participate next year as well.
